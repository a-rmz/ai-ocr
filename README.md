# AI Optical Character Recognition

### Just a unifier repository.

The repositories are included as [submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). To use them, you can download this repository and initialize the submodules. Taken from the Git documents:

```You must run two commands: git submodule init to initialize your local configuration file, and git submodule update to fetch all the data from that project and check out the appropriate commit listed in your superproject.

There is another way to do this which is a little simpler, however. If you pass --recursive to the git clone command, it will automatically initialize and update each submodule in the repository.```
